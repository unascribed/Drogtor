<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a nickname mod for Forge 1.4. You try naming mods; it's not easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run /nick followed by your desired nickname. Run /color followed by a color to set your name color to that. 15 of the 16 Minecraft colors are supported. (No, you can't use black.)</p>
<p><strong>Drogtor does not perform validation that the nick is not taken.</strong> It is assumed you trust your players. This may change in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run /nick or /color with no arguments to reset to default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Works server-side only.</p>
